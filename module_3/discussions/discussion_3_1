Learning Outcome: Share decision-making process in light of uncertainty and ambiguity

Most of our lives, we have incomplete information to make a decision, even a really important ones. Decisions such as: which class should I take, should I say yes to this job in New York City, should I adopt a dog, should I buy a house? 

As it turns out, this is made even harder since humans really do not like uncertainty; we have a hard time when our expectations do not meet our predictions. The world is full of uncertainty, and we all have to learn to deal with it as best we can, and learn to make the most out of the limited information you have now and in the future.

How do you make decisions when you do not have all the information? What seems to work, what doesn't? How do you feel and cope when your expectations are not met?
