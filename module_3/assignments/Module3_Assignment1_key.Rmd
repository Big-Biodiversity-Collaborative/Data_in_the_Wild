# Assignment Details

### Purpose

The goal of this assignment is to assess your ability to compare means numerically, visually, and statistically

### Task

Write R code which produces the correct answers and correctly interpret the results of visualizations and statistical tests.

### Criteria for Success

-   Code is within the provided code chunks
-   Code is commented with brief descriptions of what the code does
-   Code chunks run without errors
-   Code produces the correct result
    -   Code that produces the correct answer will receive full credit
    -   Code attempts with logical direction will receive partial credit
-   Written answers address the questions in sufficient detail

### Due Date

April 4 at midnight MST

# Assignment Questions

In this assignment, we're going to explore another data set on wind turbines that generate a significant portion of the energy for us down here in Antarctica.

### Set-Up

Let's load the `tidyverse` and read in the data set. Call the data `turbines`.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
turbines <- read_csv("../data/wind_turbines.csv")
turbines
```

1.  Explore the data set, either through the environment or through code. Answer the following questions (2 point):

    a.  How many turbine makers are there? 2
    b.  What does each row of data represent? one turbine

    ```{r}
    # optional; only if you want space for coding
    ```

### Numeric

2.  Generate a summary of the data set that calculates the mean wind speed and mean power output for each wind turbine company. (2 point)

```{r}
turbine_summary <- turbines %>% 
  group_by(manufacturer) %>% 
  summarise(mean_wind_speed = mean(wind_speed),
            mean_power = mean(power_output))
turbine_summary
```

### Visual

3.  Create a density plot for the power output variable. (3 points)
    -   be sure to have a density plot for each turbine producer; the color and the fill should be determined by the maker of the turbine
    -   add in vertical lines for the mean values in the same color as the turbine makers
    -   make sure the x-axis, y-axis, and legend labels are capitalized and easier to understand (power output in measured in kilowatts, or kWh)
    -   use the `theme_classic()` function

```{r}
ggplot(turbines, aes(power_output, color = manufacturer, fill = manufacturer)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_vline(data = turbine_summary, aes(xintercept = mean_power, color = manufacturer)) +
  labs(x = "Power Output", # any way of adding cleaner labels is fine
       y = "Density",
       color = "Manufacturer",
       fill = "Manufacturer") +
  theme_classic()

### the answer key that I gave them accidentally had wind speed as the x-axis label
### because of that, they can use wind speed OR power output in the question
```

4.  Generate a box-and-whisker plot using `ggplot2` that compares the wind speed between different turbine makers (3 points).

    The plot should:

    -   have capitalized and more descriptive axis labels (hint: wind speed is measured in kilometers per hour---km/hr)
    -   show raw data points in addition to the boxes. The points should be jittered.
    -   use the `theme_classic()` function

```{r}
ggplot(turbines, aes(manufacturer, wind_speed)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.5) + #transparency & width are optional
  labs(x = "Maker", # any way of adding cleaner labels is fine
       y = "Wind Speed (km/hr)") +
  theme_classic()
```

### Statistic

5.  Write a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis for the question we are asking and that we will be using statistics to answer. (2 points)

    **Null Hypothesis** (H~0~):Â there is no difference in power output and wind speed between the turbine makers **Alternative Hypothesis** (H~A~): there is a difference in power output and wind speed between the turbine makers

6.  Based on the mean values in the `turbine_summary` data frame and the plots you've created above, predict the outcome of each t-test (graded for completion, not accuracy). Explain your reasoning (1-2 sentences for each t-test is fine). (2 points)

    *Answer:* graded for completion only

    -   power output (histogram) looks like probably yes, p \< 0.05; wind speed (boxplot) looks like maybe no

7.  Perform a t-test on the power output by turbine maker. (1 point)

```{r}
t.test(data = turbines, power_output ~ manufacturer)
```

8.  In 2-3 sentences, interpret the output from question 7. Focus on what the p-value is in reference to the cutoff of 0.05, what that means, and whether that means we accept or reject the null hypothesis. (2 points)

    *Answer:* p \< 0.05 so there is a significant difference and we reject the null

9.  Perform another t-test, this time on the wind_speed variable by manufacturer. (1 point)

```{r}
t.test(data = turbines, wind_speed ~ manufacturer)
```

10. In 2-3 sentences, interpret the output from question 9 (focus on the same ideas as question 8). (2 points)

    *Answer:* p \> 0.05 so there is no difference and we fail to reject (it's ok if they say accept) the null
