# A Visualization Primer

## Why Does Data Visualization Matter?

### On your own

Take a few minutes to write down your top 3 reasons why data visualization is important or useful to you

### Small Groups

As a group, take 5 minutes to compare your notes and come to a group consensus on your top 3 reasons. Be sure to choose someone to report out!

## Types of Visualization

### Visual cues for communicating data

[Here](http://paldhous.github.io/ucb/2016/dataviz/week2.html) is a decent overview of some of the core concepts of data visualization.

This website is pretty great and goes into a lot of detail about good practices in data visualization. If this is something that really piques your interest, I encourage you to check it out!

In this course, our main take-away from this website is the use of visual cues to communicate data and which ones are better than others.

### Small group activity

In groups, discuss as many all types of visualization that come to mind. It's okay if you don't know what they are called! Make a quick list or draw them out if you prefer.

Types of data visualizations: bar graphs, bow-and-whisker plot, pie chart, line graph, histogram, pyramid chart, gantt chart, scatter plot, time series, word cloud, venn diagram, heatmap, density plot, topographic map

[This website](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) is an amazing reference for data visualization methods and when to use what. It also has examples of each type plotted in `ggplot2`.

We will talk more about how to choose the right visualization for your data now and also in the rest of the module.

### Data matching activity

Still in your groups, open the PDF called "data_viz_matching_exercise"

Spend a few minutes seeing if you can match the data descriptions to the types of data visualizations.

*Note: these plots do not represent the data, just a type of data visualization.*

This is a challenging exercise, so don't panic if you feel a little lost! Here are some things to help you think through which visualizations might be appropriate:

-   how many variables are in the data description?
-   how many variables are represented in the data visualization? Look at the axes, sizes, colors, etc.
-   how is *one* data point represented on the plot?
-   how is variation in the data represented on the plot, if at all?

## Figure Critique

First, read through [this blog post](https://humansofdata.atlan.com/2019/02/dos-donts-data-visualization/) on the "Dos and Don'ts of Data Visualization"

Now that you have some insights, let's critique these figures below. Yes, these are actual figures in the wild...

-   what aspects don't work
-   what aspects do work
-   how how you present the data?
