Learning Outcome: Identify data science applications in human societies

Computational thinking, data science, math--all words that might strike fear in
our hearts and mind. I used to think that I couldn't be good at these things! 

Did you know, though, that dogs do calculus all the time? They use it to play 
fetch and catch balls. Just because they don't use it in the way we might expect
doesn't mean they aren't using it!

Now that you know more about what data science and computational thinking are, 
how do _you_ use these ways of thinking in your everyday life? 

Your post should be around 6-8 sentences long with a clear topic sentence at the
beginning of each paragraph.

Please add at least 2 citations of lecture material or outside sources to add a 
broader expertise and knowledge base to your argument.
