# Assignment Description

### Purpose

The goal of this assignment is to get comfortable using R to look at 1- and 2-dimensional data sets.

### Task

Write R code to successfully answer each question below.

### Criteria for Success

-   Code is within the provided code chunks
-   Code chunks run without errors
-   Code produces the correct result
    -   Code that produces the correct answer will receive full credit
    -   Code attempts with logical direction will receive partial credit
-   Written answers address the questions in sufficient detail

### Due Date

February 7 at midnight MST

# Assignment Questions

*Remember to run each chunk of code as you go!*

Each question is worth 2 points.

## Vectors

Let's start working with vectors, or 1-dimensional data, first.

**IMPORTANT!**\
Run this chunk of code to create a vector of data to use.

```{r vector}
# vector with counts of penguins
counts <- c(2, 9, 4, 3, 6, 7, 1, 0, 3)
```

1.  What data class is `counts`? Write a line of code that tells you.

```{r data_class}

```

2.  Write a line of code that pulls out the 2nd value in the `counts` vector.

```{r second_value}

```

3.  Calculate the average number of penguins that were counted.

```{r avg_penguins}

```

## Data Frames

Now that we've practiced with vectors, let's move on to 2-dimensional data.

Remember that quiz we took in class with fun/silly questions about our trip to Antarctica? It's time to play around with that data!

**IMPORTANT!**\
The following code chunk will read in the data. Be sure to run it before try to answer the questions! A bunch of stuff will pop up, but it should work just fine.

```{r import_data}
library(tidyverse)
team_data <- read_csv("../data/team_antarctica_responses.csv") %>% drop_na()
```

Running the code chunk above produces a message that gives us some useful information, even before we look at the data set (alternatively, you can check it out in the environment tab to the right).

-   What are the dimensions of the data?
-   What are the names of the columns in the data?
-   What data *class* do you expect to find in each column (i.e., numbers, character strings, T/F, etc.)

4.  Take a look at the data frame using the `head()` function. Typically, `head()` provides the first 6 rows of data. Modify one of the arguments in `head()` so that the line of code prints the first 10 rows. (If you aren't sure how to do that, remember how you can look for help about functions!)

```{r examine_data}

```

5.  Using what you know about sub-setting data frames, write a line of code the pulls out the parka color for uniqueID 9 (row 9). (Hint: count the columns!)

```{r parka7}

```

When we have a large data set like this, it is often helpful to summarize the data in some way. The next few questions will help use get a better understanding of the content of the data set.

6.  On average, how did people rate their cold tolerance?

```{r average_cold_tolerance}

```

7.  What is the minimum and maximum distance that would be traveled by a team member to get to Antarctica? Use `min()` and `max()`.

```{r min_max_distance}

```

8.  Create a data frame that only includes rows of data for people who rated their cooking skills as a 5. (Hint: numbers do not need quotation marks around them).

```{r cooking_skill}
team_data[team_data$cooking_skill == 5,]
```

9.  How many different parka colors will we have? This will require two steps (2 points per step).

    a.  First, use the `unique()` function to pull out each distinct value from the `parka_color` column. Save this as an object called `colors`, which is now a vector.
    b.  Use the `length()` function to count how many distinct specialties are in the `colors` vector.

```{r parka_colors}
# 9a

# 9b

```

## Bonus (up to 2 points)!

What animal should be on our team flag?

First, create a vector called `mascot` that has only the values from the `flag_mascot` column. Next, use the `table()` function on the `mascot`. This will give you the number of times each option was chosen. According to the results, which animal should be on our team flag?

*Answer:*

```{r flag_mascot}

```
